# Pendulum-Simulation
A simple starter simulation of a pendulum. Uses semi-realistic values to simulate a pendulum system (single pendulum; not double)

Uses fully pygame to simulate a pendulum.

By product of my curiosity in the Work-Energy unit in physics class. I have a current desire to explain many physical systems and simulate them.
